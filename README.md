# Meta LAND small project idea about metaverse 

I build an entire metaverse application we'll create the 3d world inside the browser using web3js and we'll create the virtual lens smart contract on the blockchain using solidity .

I build a metavese where you can buy and own virtual land so this application is similar to the biggest metavest applications out there that thousands of people use and interact with on a daily basis so you'll learn the ins and outs of how a metaverse works and how to build a 3d world where you can buy virtual land on the blockchain .

what's blockchain virtual land ?
 what is the purpose of owning virtual lan in the metaverse so metaverse is any video game or 3d world where you can buy virtual land and simulate real life experiences example for metabours would be decentraland 

 the metaverse worked differently where you had some user interface like a website or desktop app that you can interact with and get access to all the virtual lan and coins you have in the game on a central server so all the coins in uh lan using the metaverse are hosted on a central server and this represents a problem since the people who have access to this central server and database can arbitrarily freeze your account and create new coins and this is why you don't really own theland but the people who control the central server do and this is where blockchain comes in what is blockchain blockchain is a decentralized network of computers.

  blockchain the perfect place to create and buy virtual land and this is why metaverse applications are using blockchain as a backbone for their virtual lan instead of a server like they did before what is virtual lane i've already talked about this but itâ€™s similar to land in the real world but instead of this land existing in the real world it exists on the blockchain and once you buy the land on the blockchain you can access it in the metaverse and use this land in 3d cities where users can simulate real life pursuits such as shopping or buying groceries so what is the purpose of owning virtual land in the metaverse so similar to owning a land in the real world you can use this land to create businesses that operate within the metaverse you can host parties have people come and gather around on your plot of land you can even make money by creating play-to-play experiences and host concerts like we've seen some musicians do or you can develop a virtual property and rent it out this is how our metaverse will work on a high.

  ## plan in the future:

-  will Develop a Metaverse interface by use Three.js will allow us to create and display 3d content in the browser.

## Technology Stack & Tools
- `Solidity` (`Writing Smart Contract`)
- `Javascript` (`React & Testing`)
- [Web3]`(Blockchain Interaction)`
- [Truffle]`(Development Framework)`
- [Ganache]`(For Local Blockchain)`
- [MetaMask]`(Ethereum Wallet)`
- [ThreeJS]`(3D Javascript library)`
- [@react-three/fiber]`(React renderer for Three.js)`
- [@react-three/drei]

## Requirements For Initial Setup
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), I recommend using node version v14 or v16 to avoid any potential dependency issues
- Install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview), In your terminal, you can check to see if you have truffle by running `truffle --version`. To install truffle run `npm i -g truffle`.
- Install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
- Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) in your browser.


### 2. Install Dependencies:
`$ npm install `

### 3. Migrate Smart Contracts
`$ truffle migrate --reset`

### 4. Test Smart Contracts
`$ truffle test`

### 5. Start Frontend
`$ npm start`
